				<h1>National Cybersecurity Strategy IV (SNCC IV)</h1>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					The world in 2021 is facing a multitude of international crises, ranging
					from the health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to the climate crisis,
					but also a deep crisis related to the social contract and political confidence
					in many countries.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>All these crises have complex but undeniable relationships with information
					and communication technologies and systems: society’s dependence on the
					Internet and connectivity is growing.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					At the same time, the attack surface is becoming more diverse with the
					introduction of new technologies, while geopolitical rivalries are impacting
					the security of the digital space. Malicious acts are undertaken by a multitude
					of state and non-state actors against diverse targets: government administrations,
					businesses and citizens are victims of such acts.

				<p>
					With the massive introduction of fifth generation (5G) mobile data transmission,
					which promises to revolutionise connectivity worldwide, both for industrial and
					mission-critical applications and users/citizens, society will benefit from
					unprecedented speed of access to information and data availability, increased
					responsiveness and a significant improvement in connectivity capabilities.
				</p>

				<p>
					The transition to increasingly mobile technologies and the ever-increasing reliance
					on cloud computing solutions, as well as the continued development of the Internet
					of Things mean that human societies are increasingly connected but at the same time
					increasingly dependent on the availability and reliability of their data. Advances in
					quantum computing research suggest that the race between encryption and decryption
					technologies will continue.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						This underlines the collective responsibility of political actors, ICT experts
						and industry, as well as citizens of all ages to become more independent and to
						use technology wisely, and even to demand trusted services and tools that meet
						their needs.

				<h2>
					A national cybersecurity strategy to support today’s requirements, needs,
					expectations and upcoming developments
				</h2>

				<p>
					The development of a new national cybersecurity strategy is a prime opportunity
					to review the state’s stance on information security awareness. In a spirit of
					openness and collaboration, the new strategy has been submitted for consultation
					to stakeholders at the national level: relevant ministries and administrations,
					private companies, professional information security researchers and civil society
					organisations.
				</p>

				<p>
					Luxembourg will engage more proactively in positive cooperation initiatives at
					global level, such as in the United Nations Secretary-General’s Digital
					Cooperation Action Plan. At European level, the EU’s digital hub is in a
					process of consolidation in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The national
					cybersecurity ecosystem is booming.
				</p>

				<p>
					This strategy is part of a continuous process of improving coordination and
					procedures in the field of information security and builds on the lessons
					learned from the three previous national strategies (National Cybersecurity
					<a href="https://cybersecurite.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/scs-1-2011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> I (2012)</a>,
					<a href="https://cybersecurite.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/lu-ncss-2-fr-booklet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> II (2015)</a> and

				</p>

				<h3>
					Objectives and priorities of the NCSS IV
				</h3>

				<p>
					Luxembourg’s fourth national strategy builds on the foundations of the three
					previous strategies. It comprises three strategic objectives, which each have
					several strategic priorities. Multiple concrete and measurable actions, which are
					set out in an internal monitoring table (available upon request from info@hcpn.etat.lu),
					are grouped under each priority.
				</p>

				<h4>
					Objective I: Building trust in the digital world and protection of human rights online
				</h4>

				<p>
					<i>
						The first obligation of the State is to protect its citizens and guarantee their
						fundamental rights and freedoms. In a society that is permanently connected to the
						Internet and multi-dependent on computer networks and systems, there are many risks
						and threats to living together and to the rights of each individual. The protection
						of this civic space in line with all human rights – civil, political, economic,
						social, cultural, and environmental – is the first objective of this strategy.
					</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						Question: will the strategy be updated as a pdf or will we be able to link a
						content behind each of the following objectives?
					</b>
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>I.1 Protection of human rights online</li>
					<li>I.2 Protection of children and young people’s rights</li>
					<li>I.3 Safe Digital Inclusion</li>
					<li>I.4 Cybersecurity education and vocational training</li>
					<li>I.5 Pen-testing, bug bounties and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities</li>
					<li>I.6 Combating cybercrime</li>
					<li>I.7 Secure democratic and civic participation</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>
					Objective II: Strengthening the security and resilience of digital infrastructures
					in Luxembourg
				</h4>

				<p>
					<i>
						The availability, integrity and confidentiality of data are the objectives of
						cybersecurity: faced with the numerous cyber incidents observed daily, as well
						as the risks and threats observed on the horizon, the Government has chosen to
						prioritise strengthening the security and resilience of digital infrastructures
						as a second strategic objective.
					</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						Question: will the strategy be updated as a pdf or will we be able to link a
						content behind each of the following objectives?
					</b>
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>II.1 Strengthening the security and resilience of the State’s digital
					processes and information and communication systems</li>
					<li>II.2 Secure and controlled use of the public cloud at state level</li>
					<li>II.3 Ensuring digital sovereignty</li>
					<li>II.4 Continuous improvement of incident detection and management</li>
					<li>II.5 Cyber situational analysis (cyber weather) and cyber intelligence</li>
					<li>II.6 Risk assessment and management</li>
					<li>II.7 Critical infrastructure protection</li>
					<li>II.8 Security of the networks and information systems of essential service
					operators</li>
					<li>II.9 Cybersecurity in the health sector</li>
					<li>II.10 Improvement of national and international cyber crisis management
					processes and procedures</li>
					<li>II.11 European obligations on the security of telecommunications networks
					and services</li>
					<li>II.12 Supply chain security </li>
					<li>II.13 Securing e-mail communications at national level</li>
					<li>II.14 Securing communications and data through the use of quantum technologies</li>
					<li>II.15 Operationalisation of the national cyber defence strategy</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>
					Objective III: Development of a reliable, sustainable and secure digital economy
				</h4>

				<p>
					<i>
						“Openness, dynamism and reliability”: the Luxembourg Government’s strategy
						of economic dynamism and diversification is largely based on the continuous
						development of a high-performance digital economy. Cybersecurity is essential
						for the smooth functioning of the relations, transactions, services and other
						interactions that underpin the digital economy.
					</i>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>
						Question: will the strategy be updated as a pdf or will we be able to link
						a content behind each of the following objectives?
					</b>
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>III.1 Federation of the Luxembourg Cybersecurity Ecosystem</li>
					<li>III.2 Federation of the Luxembourg Cybersecurity Research Ecosystem</li>
					<li>III.3 Development of certification, testing and standardisation methodologies</li>
					<li>III.4 Creation of the first cybersecurity data space in Europe</li>
					<li>III.5 Capitalisation on the Cybersecurity Competence Centre (C3)</li>
					<li>III.6 Consolidation of the European digital cluster in Luxembourg</li>
					<li>III.7 Capacity building at national and international level</li>
					<li>III.8 Intensifying partnerships with industry, research and civil society</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					To achieve these 3 objectives, Luxembourg relies on a strong national cybersecurity
					governance framework and proven preparedness, response and recovery measures.
				</p>

				<p>
					The growth of the digital market goes hand in hand with strong increase in
					the need for trainers and cybersecurity professionals. In an effort to engage
					cybersecurity experts in the future, training curricula will be updated to further
					include the topic of cybersecurity.
